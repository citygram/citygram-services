# spy-glass (aka Citygram connector)

__Spyglass__  is a [Code for America](https://github.com/codeforamerica) project by the [Charlotte Team](http://team-charlotte.tumblr.com/) for the [2014 fellowship](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/our-geeks/2014-fellows/).

### What does this do now?

This is a registry of micro ETL endpoints. What does that even mean? Good question. Citygram has good [overview documentation](https://github.com/codeforamerica/citygram/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Citygram). 

But here's a specific example of the information flow:

[CKAN code enforcement](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9)  -> [Citygram connector](https://github.com/BetaNYC/citygram-services-nyc/blob/nyc-updates/lib/spy_glass/registry/nyc-311.rb) -> [Citygram](https://www.citygram.nyc/)

This particular Citygram connector pulls the [last seven days worth](https://github.com/BetaNYC/citygram-services-nyc/blob/master/lib/spy_glass/registry/nyc-311.rb#L8) of code complaints and [formats them as geojson](https://citygram-services-nyc.herokuapp.com/) that Citygram polls many times a day.

It creates a unique key that [is a composite](https://github.com/BetaNYC/citygram-services-nyc/blob/nyc-updates/lib/spy_glass/registry/nyc-311.rb#L45) of the CaseNo and Status columns. When this key changes, Citygram will create a new event that will be sent to subscribers. Since the key is a composite, an event is created whenever a status changes for a given case.
